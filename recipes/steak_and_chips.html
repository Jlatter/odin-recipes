        <p>A simple yet flavourful recipe for steak and chips</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>600g medium-sized King Edward potatoes or Maris Piper potatoes</li>
            <li>sunflower oil , for frying</li>
            <li>2 x 200g/8oz beef steaks</li>
            <li>2 handfuls mixed leaves</li>
            <li>dressing of your choice, to serve</li>
            <li><strong>For the butter</strong></li>
            <li>50g butter , softened</li>
            <li>small handful parsley leaves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 small garlic clove , minced (optional)</li>
            <li>small squeeze lemon juice</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First make the butter: mash all the ingredients together with lots of cracked black pepper.<br> 
                Pat the butter flat between cling film (it'll chill quicker when thinner) and put in the fridge<br>
                 or freezer to harden.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes into neat chips, rinse under hot water, then dry on a tea towel. Place the chips<br>
                 in a deep saucepan (they should only come up a third of the way) and just cover with cold oil.<br>
                 Place the pan on a medium heat, bring the oil to a simmer and give the chips a stir with a wooden<br>
                  spoon. Increase the heat so the oil bubbles really quickly and fry the chips, stirring<br>
                  occasionally so they don't stick, until crisp and golden - the whole process will take 15-20 mins.<br>
                   When they are done, scoop out with a slotted spoon onto a plate lined with kitchen paper and set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the griddle pan until smoking hot. Season the steaks with salt and pepper and rub with<br>
                 a little oil - how you cook your steak will depend on the cut you have chosen and its thickness. For <br>
                 a steak that's 2cm thick, cook it for 2 mins on each side for rare, adding 1 min more for every increasing<br>
                  degree of doneness. Just before lifting the steaks off the griddle, place half the butter on top of each.<br>
                   Serve the steaks with the chips, some mixed leaves and a tangy dressing.</li>
            </ol>
