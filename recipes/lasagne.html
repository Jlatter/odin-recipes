<p>A simple ricotta and tomato lasagne recipe</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 pound (454g) box of dry lasagna noodles fitted to your pan (you might not need all of it; I use De Cecco Lasagna No. 1, which fits the 8 inch pan)</li>
    <li>1 28 oz (800g) can of crushed tomatoes (you might not need all of it; I use Pastene Kitchen Ready or Muir Glen)</li>
    <li>1 pound (454g) ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 pound (454g) grated mozzarella (you might not need all of it)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated parmesan or pecorino</li>
    <li>olive oil</li>
    <li>salt</li>
    <li>seasonings (I use garlic & onion powder, dried oregano/basil/parsley/marjoram, dried chili flakes and pepper)</li>
    <li>fresh herb for garnish (I use basil)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cover the bottom of the pan with a layer of crushed tomatoes, drizzle in a little olive oil,<br>
         and season that layer lightly with salt and your other herbs and spices. Lay in the first layer<br>
          of lasagna noodles (don't parboil them first), and dust them with a little salt. Lay in a layer<br>
           of ricotta and sprinkle on some mozzarella and parmesan. Lay in your second pasta layer and<br>
           sprinkle them with a little salt. Lay in more tomatoes and repeat until you have built at least<br> 
           four layers, with tomatoes atop the final layer, making sure to reserve tome mozzarella for melting on the top later.</li>
    
    <li>Cover the pan tightly with foil and bake it for about 45 minutes. Take the foil off, sprinkle on some<br>
         mozzarella and bake for another 15 minutes. At the very end, turn on the broiler (grill) to brown the<br>
         cheese to your liking  this should only take a couple minutes, so watch it closely.</li>
    
    <li>Let cool at least 15 minutes before cutting and serving with fresh herbs.<br> 
        If you want a tidier presentation, chill the lasagna whole in the fridge.<br>
         When it's firm, you'll get cleaner edges when you cut. Reheat the cut pieces<br>
         on top of a little splash of water in a covered baking dish in the oven <br>
         for 15 minutes. Uncover and broil on a little more mozzarella, to make the top look nicer.</li>
    </ol>
